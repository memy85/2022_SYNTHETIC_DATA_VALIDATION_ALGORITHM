# 2022_SYNTHETIC_DATA_VALIDATION_ALGORITHM
- Author : Won Seok Jang
- Objective : This code is for checking the validity of synthetic data with various methods


## Data evaluation
1. Data Utility
    - KL divergence metric
    - Log Cluster metric
    - TSTR
        - train on synthetic test on synthetic and real
        - train on real test on synthetic and real

2. Data Privacy
    1. Membership disclosure
        - distance metric : Hamming distance
    2. Attribute disclosure
        - specify known attributes e.g. age, sex, death, .. etc
